|	Short description	| This deliverable	provides the outputs of the 3D geomodelling of the layered deposits on the Chang'e 3 landing site and Yutu rover path in Sinus Iridum on the Moon based on Yutu rover GPR data. The data has been entirely produced by using open source tools to enhance replicability of the whole processing steps. |
